# Sales data analysis
This project is about analyzing sales data. The data collection used in this research includes monthly information on the name of the product purchased, the order ID, the date, and the location of purchase.

I've obtained some useful information from the data provided, which has a wide range of applications:

# 1.At what time should the advertisements be displayed to increase the likelihood of the customer buying the product?

Conclusion: Most of the orders were placed at 12:00 and 19:00. This shows that most of the users are active at these times, which can be a perfect time for advertisements.

# 2.Which items are frequently bought together? This information can be used to give product suggestions to customers, which might be helpful to increase sales.

Here's a list of 2 items that were frequently bought together.
